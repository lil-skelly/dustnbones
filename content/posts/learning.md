Over the years, you have *most likely* come across a feature in a programming language which seemed amazing to **you**.
No need for it being a breaking one, and it has probably not been loved as much if it weren't for you.

For some apparent reason you seem to love this feature, finding it elegant yet genuinely simple to comprehend. You revise your projects to find the appropriate room for this beloved feature to seamlessly fit in, adding to the delicacy of your well structured and now *elegant* code.

I have been there. We all have. The pleasure you get from finally finding the perfect chance to use something you learnt is unforgettable and unimaginable.

This applies to most things in life, **obtaining** knowledge sure is **hard** but it is just preparing you for the *climax* of happiness you will reach when your knowledge actually pays off, when you find yourself saying `'This is exactly why I learnt this'`, when you understand that the pain learning can sometimes endure, simply holds you back from getting ahead of yourself.

What I want to say is, keep on learning, connect those neurons and it will pay off when the time is right.
