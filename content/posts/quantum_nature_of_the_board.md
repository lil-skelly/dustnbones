> “It is not a move, even the best move, that you must seek, but a realizable plan. - Richard Retí

Chess is a very interesting game. Largely due to the insanely vast number of possible moves that arise after each move. The possibilities unfold in a tree of endlessly different chess games, but we only come across a single branch of that tree.

This paper is not to be confused with anything of a scientific nature, as it is nothing more than my casual philosophical rant.

Consider this: you are having a game of chess and it is your turn to make a move. All you have to do is make a move. At that point in time, the board is nothing more than a deterministic system with a very specific state. So what is stopping you?

I believe that **at the moment** you get into this state of decision making, the board is at *superposition*.

All the possible moves coexist on the **same** board. But when you finally touch a piece with your now trembling hands this delicate balance collapses, once and for all. The rest of the branches vanish --they were unreal. In fact, they always were, *at least to you*.

We can conclude that no problem is straightforward. In the search for a solution, the problem suddenly enters a chaotic state which only collapses upon observation -- when you finally choose. At that moment, all of the possibilities cease to exist. They never truly did, but their potential was real.
