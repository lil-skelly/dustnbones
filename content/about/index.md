Hello world. I am `Skelly`, a student who is fascinated with IT, especially cyber security. 
My parents got me my first computer in the age of 3. It was a chunky Macintosh desktop *probably the best gift I got from them, besides me (of course)*. Some years later (after I smh broke that piece of Apple art) I got an HP desktop rolling Windows 7 *Pro*, which I still use to this very day (*edit: I now run linux bare metal because windows dislikes dualboots :P*).

I started playing with the good old batch and VBS scripts on windows, making simple prankware and messing around with my schools computers.
Then I found out *by mistake* about high-level programming languages, and started learning Python (no comment).

I got it to a pretty decent level over the years and worked on some cool projects.

After taking a big break of almost 2 years, I am back in the game, started learning C, and some Red Teaming *stuff* as well as working on a series of questionable yet interesting [projects](https://github.com/lil-skelly).
